For the love of music

	I’ve decided to retract my original decision to make a website/blog on rising student loans and the effects it has on our generation for a couple reasons.  Although I do think it’s an important topic, it’s also extremely complicated as is and for a first time web designer I don’t think it’s a task that I can complete efficiently and my new topic is much more fun.  So, for my final project I’ve decided my topic would be creating a website for my music tastes, a place to share new music, rising artists and well-known artists as well.  I hope for the website to be interactive, a forum for students and fans to have lively discussions on any new songs and albums.  I’d also announce upcoming shows mainly in New York City of favorite artists, bands, DJ’s etc. along with the locations, ticket prices, any recent albums, singles or sets from the artist and the what they’ve been up to leading up to shows.  It’s sometimes difficult to find people who have the same music tastes as you.  I’m not sure if this website will go beyond this class but it can even be a website for students to find other students who dig the same music as you do and go to events together, make new friends and create new memories through the love of music.
